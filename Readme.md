## How the game was design
The first step was to look for **What is an RPG game?**, then I looked for some inspiration, watching videos like **Top 10 nes RPG games**. After all this process, I started to brainstorm and just picked, the ones that looked realistic to build in 3 days, because 2 days were for study.

I answered questions to myself like, who is going to be the main character?
who is going to be the bad guy?
how many bad guys will be there?
what type of skills?
what is the objective of the game?
how the user will interact with the game?

And so on. This bunch of questions helped a lot to design the game.

## How the game was developed
Since I'm a very newbie with phaser 3, I checked a lot of tutorials on how to make a turn-based RPG game. Some of them were the base to build the final game. Also, I reached to other developers when I struggled. Always ask for help!
