# Rpg turn based game using phaser 3 and an api provided by [@microverse](https://github.com/microverseinc/)

> This is a 5 days project, part of Microverse, as a final solo project to apply all knowledge obtained during Javascript curriculum.

## How the game was design
The first step was to look for **What is an RPG game?**, then I looked for some inspiration, watching videos like **Top 10 nes RPG games**. After all this process, I started to brainstorm and just picked, the ones that looked realistic to build in 3 days, because 2 days were for study. Also after reading the following readings, feel free to check it out: [The 3 Primary Principles of Game Design](https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/game-design-principles/), [Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Game Mechanics](https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/basic-game-mechanics/), [The Ultimate Guide to Level Design](https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/level-design/), I generated the following questions to myself:
_who is going to be the main character?_,
_who is going to be the bad guy?_,
_how many bad guys will be there?_,
_what type of skills?_,
_what is the objective of the game?_,
_how the user will interact with the game?_

And so on. This bunch of questions helped a lot to design the game. Also checking many resources in [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/), gave me and inspired me with more ideas.

## How the game was developed
Since I'm a very newbie with phaser 3, I checked a lot of tutorials on how to make a turn-based RPG game. Some of them were the base to build the final game. Also, I reached to other developers when I struggled. Always ask for help!

## Built With ‚ú®
- JavaScript ECMA6
- Node.js v11.9.0
- webpack 4.41.2
- [phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js installed
This project is only tested with node v11.9.0

* System dependencies
Windows/ Mac


### Local Install
Clone project and run
`npm install`

After all dependencies install, run:
`npm run start`

The project runs on http://localhost:8080/


### How to play
Use arrow keys to move (up, down, left, right). When you enter onto a battle, pulse left arrow to select an enemy (name of the enemy will turn yellow!), then you can attack it pressing left arrow or space bar :smiley:. Good luck since these enemies randomly change their attack, sometimes you will handle weak enemies, other times they will be stronger (they can kill you in 2 hits).

## How to contribute and partipate
Fork this repo and submit a PR for review and potential merge to main branch. Feel free to leave feedback :smile:
